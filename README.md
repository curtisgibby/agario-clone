# Pandagario

This is a simple Agar.io clone built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Move your panda using the arrow keys and gobble up the dots to grow larger. Avoid larger dots to survive!

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your panda.
- Gobble up smaller dots to grow larger.
- Avoid larger dots to prevent losing.
- The game ends when your circle becomes half the size of the canvas.
